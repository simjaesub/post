3d Singe cage deformed state

deformed state = 250s
initial state = 0s

green colored lines = frame cables
blue colored lines = netting
black colored lines = mooring lines
red colored lines = bridles
bold black colored line = line that connects the point where the bridle is attached

the plot shows that the first layer of the netting is deviated from the position where
the bridles are attached.

when the time is 0, it shows the match but when it is in deformed state 250s, shows mismatch between
the firstlayer of netting and the bridle connection points.
